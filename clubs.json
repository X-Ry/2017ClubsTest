Kiva uses fundraising techniques to raise money (which is loaned to applicants). The money is paid back (96.9% of the time) and can then be used to fund other projects､ creating a self-sufficient system. Because these payments are not donations､ the club strives､ at its core､ to help people help themselves out of poverty. Some Kiva project examples include: loaning a few thousand dollars to help start a small business in Lesotho､ a small loan to fund a Lebanese refugee’s higher education､ or helping a Tajikistani woman pay her husband’s increasing medical bills. Through this club､ students will be able to contribute to society､ become an informed and active citizen､ tackle complicated world issues､ and､ potentially､ change lives through microlending. Additionally､ it encourages us､ as Whitney Young students､ to appreciate our quality of life. ",

We would only have monthly meetings (seeing as not everyone thrifts often)､ and would incorporate a new concept every week (sewing with elastic､ embroidering). As the president､ I ､myself､ have never experimented with clothes and transforming them､ so it would be a learning experience for all! Its a good place to let our creative juices flow and learn new ways to wear your clothes!",
