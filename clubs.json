        "description": "Kiva Club focuses on using the power of microfinancing to improve the lives of people living in poverty across the globe as well as in our own community. Kiva uses fundraising techniques to raise money  which is then loaned to applicants. The money is paid back (97.1% of the time) and can then be used to fund other projects  creating a self-sufficient system. Because these payments are not donations  the club strives  at its core  to help people help themselves out of poverty. Some Kiva project examples include: loaning a few thousand dollars to help start a small business in Lesotho  a small loan to fund an Lebanese refugee’s higher education  or helping a Tajikistani woman pay her husband’s increasing medical bills. Through this club  students will be able to contribute to society  become an informed and active citizen  tackle complicated world issues  and  potentially  change lives through microlending. Additionally  this club encourages WY students  as US residents  to appreciate our quality of life; it allows participants to take our world view to a whole new level and see the bigger picture while simultaneously aiding those who need it the most.

To do this the book club will consist only of novels with less than three hundred pages that deal with relevant social issues that can spark serious discussion in meetings. The novels provide an emotional connection and unique opportunity for understanding for a situation that could be very different or similar to their own experiences. We hope to introduce a diverse set of ideas as well as authors to the book list. We also do understand that reading the entire book in a month is difficult for some people with different focus/ability levels and hope that by encouraging the use of SparkNotes  Wikipedia  blogs  and other resources  that people can still contribute. \n\nPossible books include:\n-Push by Sapphire\n-Milk and Honey by Rupi Kaur\n-Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi\n-And After Many Days by Jowhor Ile\n-Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng",

        "description": " As president of the club  I tend to students of all levels of the artform  ranging from teaching  beginners how to use DSLR cameras to showing advanced techniques in Photoshop to those that are more experienced. I conduct meetings once a week for an hour and a half with a group ranging typically from ten to thirty kids. Each week I give the club members an assignment which requires them to take at least five photos for the given prompt. Along with weekly assignments  some members and I participate in a longer project called One Photo a Day  where everyone takes one photo a day and puts it in a Google Drive folder. About every two months  participants in the project and myself take a meeting to reflect these captured days. Typically  I start off meetings with a discussion of the weekly assignment  giving members a chance to show their work and get constructive criticism from their peers. After the discussion  I teach a mini lesson  and give the members a chance to practice the new material in the form of an expedition  photography scavenger hunt  or exercise on the computers in our school’s Photography Lab. These lessons range from discussing other artist’s work to learning how to handle various pieces of equipment to discussing the art and compositional techniques of a photo itself. To adjourn meetings  I have the members share their work that they just created or play a game that brings everyone together. On occasion  I have planned field trips on weekends for the club members to attend with the goal of motivating them to use their new-found knowledge and skills. Finally  to raise money to help pay for equipment and various field trips for the club  I create stickers and the club helps sell them to the school. I draw these stickers on Photoshop  print them  run them through adhesive  and cut them out. So far  we have raised around $320 for the club. ",

        "description": "Our mission is to create an environment where people of differing political backgrounds can come together in a neutral space to discuss their various opinions  to find common ground and work to change their communities for the better in terms of political discussion and understanding.\nOur club is founded on the purpose of free discourse and of creating a greater community among the school’s political minds  nurturing discussion and activism regardless of affiliation or creed and aiming towards greater awareness for the school and the public at large. Much of this ethos is a result of the interesting times that we find ourselves in  especially when it comes to politics. There are many different viewpoints on every single issue  but it is rare to see a large scale of diversity of opinion represented at Whitney Young. We would like to examine each issue from many different ideological perspectives. Our club would be a place where no viewpoint is silenced  where the true power of the first amendment can be realized as the founders of this country intended. We can use the power of an open platform to create dialogue in a world where we often choose to argue rather than have a civil conversation about issues affecting our society and political system. It is more important now than it ever has been to have open discourse  and we feel that open discussions and free speech should be brought to the school of Whitney Young in order to inform and support anyone who wishes to have their voice heard. Even further than having the chance to speak is the chance to act; we intend to help and support anyone and everyone who chooses to come to us for assistance in political assistance  along with initiatives that the founding members of the club might also jump-start.",
