The money is paid back (97.1% of the time) and can then be used to fund other projects, creating a self-sufficient system. Because these payments are not donations, the club strives, at its core, to help people help themselves out of poverty. Some Kiva project examples include: loaning a few thousand dollars to help start a small business in Lesotho, a small loan to fund an Lebanese refugee’s higher education, or helping a Tajikistani woman pay her husband’s increasing medical bills. Through this club, students will be able to contribute to society, become an informed and active citizen, tackle complicated world issues, and, potentially, change lives through microlending.

I conduct meetings once a week for an hour and a half with a group ranging typically from ten to thirty kids. Each week I give the club members an assignment which requires them to take at least five photos for the given prompt. Along with weekly assignments, some members and I participate in a longer project called One Photo a Day, where everyone takes one photo a day and puts it in a Google Drive folder. About every two months, participants in the project and myself take a meeting to reflect these captured days. Typically, I start off meetings with a discussion of the weekly assignment, giving members a chance to show their work and get constructive criticism from their peers. After the discussion, I teach a mini lesson  and give the members a chance to practice the new material in the form of an expedition, photography scavenger hunt, or exercise on the computers in our school’s Photography Lab. These lessons range from discussing other artist’s work to learning how to handle various pieces of equipment to discussing the art and compositional techniques of a photo itself. To adjourn meetings, I have the members share their work that they just created or play a game that brings everyone together. On occasion, I have planned field trips on weekends for the club members to attend with the goal of motivating them to use their new-found knowledge and skills. Finally, to raise money to help pay for equipment and various field trips for the club, I create stickers and the club helps sell them to the school. I draw these stickers on Photoshop, print them, run them through adhesive, and cut them out. So far, we have raised around $320 for the club.

Much of this ethos is a result of the interesting times that we find ourselves in, especially when it comes to politics. There are many different viewpoints on every single issue, but it is rare to see a large scale of diversity of opinion represented at Whitney Young. We would like to examine each issue from many different ideological perspectives. Our club would be a place where no viewpoint is silenced, where the true power of the first amendment can be realized as the founders of this country intended. We can use the power of an open platform to create dialogue in a world where we often choose to argue rather than have a civil conversation about issues affecting our society and political system. It is more important now than it ever has been to have open discourse, and we feel that open discussions and free speech should be brought to the school of Whitney Young in order to inform and support anyone who wishes to have their voice heard. Even further than having the chance to speak is the chance to act; we intend to help and support anyone and everyone who chooses to come to us for assistance in political assistance, along with initiatives that the founding members of the club might also jump-start.","gradesIntendedToParticipate":"7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th","whatDaysAndTimesWillYourClubMeet":"Every Thursday after school from 3:30 to 4:30","howLongWillEachMeetingBe":"30-60 minutes","whereWillYourClubMeet":215,"whatAreTheFeesAssociatedWithYourClub":"up to $5","studentLeadersOfClubWithEmail":"erkresser@cps.edu"},{"timestamp":"2017-08-30T18:28:34.485Z","score":0,"nameOfClub":"Acting for Gender Equality (AGE)","mainAdvisorTeacherName":"Peter Tavolacci","mainAdvisorEmailTeachersEmail":"pjtavolacci@cps.edu","namesOfAdditionalAdvisers":"None","descriptionOfClubPleaseDescribeTheClubIncludeTheBenefitThisClubToTheWySchoolCommunity":"Club dedicated to promoting Intersectional Feminism through practice and speakers.","gradesIntendedToParticipate":"9th, 10th, 11th, 12th","whatDaysAndTimesWillYourClubMeet":"Twice--month, TBD","howLongWillEachMeetingBe":"30-60 minutes","whereWillYourClubMeet":209,"whatAreTheFeesAssociatedWithYourClub":"up to $5","studentLeadersOfClubWithEmail":"Kanyinsola Anifowoshe"},{"timestamp":"2017-09-08T13:31:51.738Z","score":0,"nameOfClub":"Badminton Club","mainAdvisorTeacherName":"Yan Chan","mainAdvisorEmailTeachersEmail":"ypchan@cps.edu","namesOfAdditionalAdvisers":"none","descriptionOfClubPleaseDescribeTheClubIncludeTheBenefitThisClubToTheWySchoolCommunity":"To Learn and play badminton","gradesIntendedToParticipate":"7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th","whatDaysAndTimesWillYourClubMeet":"every friday and 3:15 pm to 5:00 pm","howLongWillEachMeetingBe":"more than one hour","whereWillYourClubMeet":"Gym C","whatAreTheFeesAssociatedWithYourClub":"$5 - $10","studentLeadersOfClubWithEmail":"Benjamin Liu ; bcwhitneyyoung@gmail.com"},{"timestamp":"2017-08-30T01:59:35.919Z","score":0,"nameOfClub":"Best Buddies","mainAdvisorTeacherName":"Rebecca Folkerts","mainAdvisorEmailTeachersEmail":"respringer@cps.edu","namesOfAdditionalAdvisers":"n/a","descriptionOfClubPleaseDescribeTheClubIncludeTheBenefitThisClubToTheWySchoolCommunity":"Facilitates friendships between students with and without disabilities, creating a culture of inclusiveness and respect at WY.","gradesIntendedToParticipate":"7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th","whatDaysAndTimesWillYourClubMeet":"Long Division bi-weekly, after school once per month - dates TBD","howLongWillEachMeetingBe":"30-60 minutes","whereWillYourClubMeet":"Gym B","whatAreTheFeesAssociatedWithYourClub":"more than $10","studentLeadersOfClubWithEmail":"Olivia Baxter - obaxter@cps.edu; Sameehat (Sammy) Durojaiye - sdurojaiye@cps.edu"},{"timestamp":"2017-08-30T00:03:26.388Z","score":0,"nameOfClub":"BPA Business Professionals of America","mainAdvisorTeacherName":"Ms. Uhl-Alba","mainAdvisorEmailTeachersEmail":"Cmuhl-alba@cps.edu","namesOfAdditionalAdvisers":"Ms. Harris","descriptionOfClubPleaseDescribeTheClubIncludeTheBenefitThisClubToTheWySchoolCommunity":"The mission of Business Professionals of America is to contribute to the preparation of a world-class workforce through the advancement of leadership, citizenship, academic, and technological skill via conferences and local, state and national competitions.","gradesIntendedToParticipate":"7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th","whatDaysAndTimesWillYourClubMeet":"Every Wednesday 3:30-4:30","howLongWillEachMeetingBe":"more than one hour","whereWillYourClubMeet":"Unsure at this point- I still don't have a classroom","whatAreTheFeesAssociatedWithYourClub":"more than $10","studentLeadersOfClubWithEmail":"Blossom Mojekwu blossommojekwu@gmail.com"},{"timestamp":"2017-07-08T08:07:08.701Z","score":0,"nameOfClub":"Pastry club","mainAdvisorTeacherName":"Valencia Johnson","mainAdvisorEmailTeachersEmail":"vvjohnson1@cps.edu","namesOfAdditionalAdvisers":"Bryan Tyrpin","descriptionOfClubPleaseDescribeTheClubIncludeTheBenefitThisClubToTheWySchoolCommunity":"Helps students learn how to bake and cook their favorite goods ","gradesIntendedToParticipate":"7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th","whatDaysAndTimesWillYourClubMeet":"Tuesdays","howLongWillEachMeetingBe":"more than one hour","whereWillYourClubMeet":114,"whatAreTheFeesAssociatedWithYourClub":"up to $5","studentLeadersOfClubWithEmail":"ajwaeazad@gmail.com"},{"timestamp":"2017-08-18T02:23:13.206Z","score":0,"nameOfClub":"Napturally You","mainAdvisorTeacherName":"Undecided","mainAdvisorEmailTeachersEmail":"Undecided","namesOfAdditionalAdvisers":"Undecided","descriptionOfClubPleaseDescribeTheClubIncludeTheBenefitThisClubToTheWySchoolCommunity":"This club will teach every one of every background and culture how to pamper and love themselves, naturally.
