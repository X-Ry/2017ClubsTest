        "description": "Kiva Club focuses on using the power of microfinancing to improve the lives of people living in poverty across the globe as well as in our own community. Kiva uses fundraising techniques to raise money (which is loaned to applicants). The money is paid back (97% of the time) and can then be used to fund other projects creating a self-sufficient system. Because these payments are not donations the club strives at its core to help people help themselves out of poverty. Some Kiva project examples include: loaning a few thousand dollars to help start a small business in Lesotho a small loan to fund an Lebanese refugee’s higher education or helping a Tajikistani woman pay her husband’s increasing medical bills. Through this club WY students will be able to contribute to society become an informed and active citizen tackle complicated world issues and potentially change lives through microlending. Additionally it encourages us as US residents to appreciate our quality of life. ",

This club aims to maximize a student’s potential of getting into their program of choice by giving the student application tips ensuring their commitment to studying abroad getting their family on board with their vision and other topics that will be given later within this paper. We also plan on bringing in representatives from study abroad programs and colleges to tell our club members about the benefits of studying abroad  and how that may affect their college application. This will also open up opportunities for students to ask any questions they may have regarding the application process or other inquiries. This club will also help prepare students for interviews acceptances rejections culture shock financial needs and staying occupied during waiting periods. Due to the application process being time sensitive we plan on breaking down our topics of discussion into a quarterly basis. This breakdown will be shown in ‘topics of discussion’.",
